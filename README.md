# OCR-App
Application that uses Optical Character Recognition algorithms written in Python to extract the text from an image.

GUI is integrated in the script by using wxPython - wrapper for the cross-platform GUI API wxWidgets for the Python programming language. The app contains 2 working modes: Standard Noise Mode and Salt & Pepper Noise Mode. 

Upload the image that you want to extract the text from and then select the working mode accordingly: if the image contains standard noise - select the Standard Noise Mode radio button and select Salt and Pepper Mode radio button otherwise.

After uploading the image, click the Submit button to start the processing. The result will be shown on the bottom of the window.
